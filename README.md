# Python_object-oriented-study-case
This is study case I did from DQLab python language course that discuss specifically about object oriented programming using python language. In this case we're trying to create a company object that has different kinds of employee classes.
With this though I try to rewrite and costumized the code with my style of code and from what I think is the most effective way to do it.

## The Case
A company wants me to create a simple company management system that includes company's name, adress, phone number, and list of active employee the company has. Also to make it easier, they also asks me to create a function where i could activate a new employee to add to the list, or deactivate an old employee and remove them from the list.
They also asks me to add a function to calculate the total expense the company has to pay for their employees.

Here's the data of the company, and their employees:

Company's name : ConVict

Adress : Seraphim street, Block 72 

Phone number : (021) 99915XX

They also said that a data anlysts in this company usually in the age of 21, and has an income of 6,500,000 and overtime pay of 100,000. And then the data scientists usually in the age of 25, has an income of 12,000,000, with overtime pay of 150,000. On the other hand, they also employs freelancers, which usually only has an income of 4,000,000 for data cleaners and 2,500,000 for technical documenters. Some data is blank in the table, they asks me to fill in the blanks with those information they just gave me
